# Git Conflict Playground

A demo project to create and resolve intentional Git merge conflicts.

## 👨‍💻 Conflict Scenario

- Created `branch-A` and `branch-B`.
- Both branches edited the same line in `conflict.txt`.
- Merging them caused a conflict.

## 🔧 Resolution

Conflict was manually resolved by editing the file and committing the fix.
